#### -What is the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)?
	
 OSSTMM is a methodology to test the operational security of physical locations, workflow, human security testing, physical security testing, wireless security testing, telecommunication security testing, data networks security testing and compliance. OSSTMM can be supporting reference of IOS 27001 instead of a hands-on penetration testing guide.
 	
#### -OSSTMM Rules of Engagement
	
This section is quite comprehensive and one of the more useful parts of the methodology. At the beginning of a pen-testing project, OSSTMM recommends a set of activities in producing the documents covering the following:

- Project scope
- Confidentiality and non-disclosure assurance
- Emergency contact information
- Statement of work change process
- Test plan
- Test process
- Reporting standards

#### -OSSTMM Channels

 OSSTMM test cases cover most of the 10 security domains identified by the [International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC)²](https://www.isc2.org/). They are divided into five channels (alternatively called sections or security areas):
 ### **1. Human Security
 ### 2. Physical Security
 ### 3. Wireless Communications**
 ### **4. Telecommunications**
 ### **5. Data Networks**
