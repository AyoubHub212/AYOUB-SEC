The OSSTMM describes the repeatable processes within a [penetration test](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/penetration-testing "Learn more about penetration test from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") as “modules.” These modules are used in all channels as identified by the OSSTMM. Implementation of each module may be different, depending on the target system or network; however, the concepts presented below describe the high-level objective of each module (Herzog, 2008):

##  Phase I: Regulatory

■ Posture Review: Identification of regulatory and legislative policies that apply to the target. Industry practices are also considered.

■ Logistics: Because nothing occurs in a vacuum, [network latency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/network-latency "Learn more about network latency from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and [server location](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/location-server "Learn more about server location from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") can modify results; it is necessary to identify any logistical constraints present in the project.

■ Active Detection Verification: The verification of the practice and breadth of interaction detection, response, and response predictability.

## Phase II: Definitions

■ Visibility Audit: Once the scope of the project has been worked out, the pentesters need to determine the “visibility” of the targets within the project scope.

■ Access Verification: Identifies access points within the target.

■ Trust Verification: Systems often have trust relationships with other systems to do business. This module attempts to determine those relationships.

■ Controls Verification: The module measures the capability to violate confidentiality, integrity, privacy and [nonrepudiation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/nonrepudiation "Learn more about nonrepudiation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") within a system, and what controls are in place to prevent such loss.

## Phase III: Information Phase

■ [Process Verification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/verification-process "Learn more about Process Verification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"): The assessor examines what processes are in place to ensure the system’s [security posture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/security-posture "Learn more about security posture from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is maintained at its current level and the effectiveness of those processes.

■ Configuration Verification: In the Human Security channel, this module is called _Training Verification_ and examines the default operations of the target. The default operations are compared to the organization’s business needs.

■ Property Validation: Identifies intellectual property (IP) or applications on the target system and validates licensing of the IP or application.

■ Segregation Review: Attempts to identify personal information on the system, and the extent in which the information can be accessed by legitimate or unauthorized users.

■ Exposure Verification: Identifies what information is available on the Internet regarding the target system.

■ Competitive Intelligence Scouting: Identifies competitor information that might impact the target owner through competition.

##  Phase IV: Interactive Controls Test Phase

■ Quarantine Verification: Validates the system’s capability to quarantine access to the system externally and system data internally.

■ Privileges Audit: Examines the capability to elevate privileges within the system.

■ Survivability validation: In the Human Security channel, this module is called _Service Continuity_ and is used to determine the system’s resistance to excessive or adverse situations.

■ Alert and Log Review: In the Human Security channel, this module is called _End Survey_ and involves reviewing the audit activities.

Specific steps are provided in the OSSTMM so that the module’s high-level objectives are achieved and eliminate any ambiguity. Although not as specific as the steps within the ISSAF, the OSSTMM modules provide enough [granularity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/granularity "Learn more about granularity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for experienced pentest professionals to select the appropriate tools when conducting the attack. Unlike the ISSAF, the OSSTMM provides the [pentest engineer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/pentest-engineer "Learn more about pentest engineer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") some flexibility on how best to attack the target, by providing generalities on what needs to be done in the pentest. For those individuals just starting their career in the [penetration testing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/penetration-testing "Learn more about penetration testing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") field, generalities without any guidance about what tools to use or what processes to follow can be daunting.
