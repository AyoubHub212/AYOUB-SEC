## **The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)** 
 consists of seven main sections, each encompassing critical aspects of a penetration test. This comprehensive framework guides the entire process, from the initial communication and rationale behind the penetration test, to the covert intelligence gathering and threat modeling phases. These early stages involve meticulous behind-the-scenes work to gain a profound understanding of the target organization.

As the test progresses, it delves into vulnerability research, exploitation, and post-exploitation phases, where the technical security expertise of the testers seamlessly merges with their business acumen. This synergy ensures that the engagement aligns with the organization's objectives, providing valuable insights.

Finally, the PTES culminates in the reporting phase. Here, the entire process is documented and presented in a manner that is meaningful to the customer, delivering maximum value.

This version, often regarded as v1.0, represents a stable foundation, having undergone rigorous testing and validation within the industry for over a year. A forthcoming v2.0 is in development and will introduce a more nuanced approach through the concept of "levels." These levels will allow organizations to tailor the intensity of each penetration test element to their specific needs. As no two penetration tests are alike, ranging from routine web application and network assessments to full-scale red team engagements, the levels empower organizations to calibrate the sophistication they anticipate from their adversaries. Testers can then adjust the intensity in areas where an organization requires heightened scrutiny. Initial groundwork on these "levels" can be found in the intelligence gathering section.


## Following are the main sections defined by the standard as the basis for penetration testing execution:
