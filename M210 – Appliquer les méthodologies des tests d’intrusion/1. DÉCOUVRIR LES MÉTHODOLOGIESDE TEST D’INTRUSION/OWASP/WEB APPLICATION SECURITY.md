By most estimates, more than three-quarters of all cybercrime targets applications and their vulnerabilities. Web application security products and policies strive to protect applications through measures such as web application firewalls (WAFs), multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users, the use, protection, and validation of cookies to maintain user state and privacy status, and various methods for validating user input to ensure it is not malicious before that input is processed by an application.

###  Why Is Web Application Security Important?

The world today runs on apps, from online banking and remote work apps to personal entertainment delivery and e-commerce. It’s no wonder that applications are a primary target for attackers, who exploit vulnerabilities such as design flaws as well as weaknesses in APIs, open-source code, third-party widgets, and access control.

Common attacks against web applications include:

- Brute force
- Credential stuffing
- SQL injection and formjacking injections
- Cross-site scripting
- Cookie poisoning
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) and man-in-the-browser attacks
- Sensitive data disclosure
- Insecure deserialization
- Session hijacking

## How Does Web Application Security Work?

Different approaches to web application security address different vulnerabilities. [Web application firewalls (WAFs)], among the more comprehensive, defend against many types of attack by monitoring and filtering traffic between the web application and any user. Configured with policies that help determine what traffic is safe and what isn’t, a WAF can block malicious traffic, preventing it from reaching the web application and preventing the app from releasing any unauthorized data.

Other web application security methods focus on user authentication and access management, app vulnerability scanners, cookie management, traffic visibility, and IP denylists, for instance.
