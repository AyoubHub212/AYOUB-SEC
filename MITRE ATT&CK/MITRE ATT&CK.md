==MITRE ATT&CK®== stands for MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK). The MITRE ATT&CK framework is **a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the various phases of an adversary's attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target**.

#### ==WHY "MITRE"==

The word mitre **comes from the Greek μίτρα, mítra, “band”, “==bandage for the head==”, “turban”**. This ornament likely derives from a cloth band used in ancient Greece by warriors, which later evolved into an ornamental strip that women wore around their foreheads.

### History of MITRE ATTACK Framework

==MITRE== is a nonprofit organization created to provide engineering and technical guidance to the federal government. The organization originally developed the framework for use in a MITRE research project in 2013 and named for the data it collects, which is Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge-or, in acronym form, ATT&CK.

MITRE ATT&CK was released to the public for free in 2015, and today helps security teams in all sectors secure their organizations against known and emerging threats. And while MITRE ATT&CK originally focused on threats against Windows enterprise systems, today it also covers Linux, mobile, macOS, and ICS.

ATT&CK = Adversarial Tactics Techniques and Common Knoeledge

--------

==### What are "tactics"?==

Tactics represent the “why” of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. It is the adversary’s tactical goal: the reason for performing an action. For example, an adversary may want to achieve credential access.

###  ==What are "techniques"?==

Techniques represent 'how' an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action. For example, an adversary may dump credentials to achieve credential access.

## ==how to use mitre att&ck== 

the power of the MITRE ATT&CK is that he cover all attacks that a hacker can do to an entreprise, windows, macos, kali, cloud, mobile . 

you can choose the one that u wanna see his tactics and techniques of it   .


## ==There are several different matrices:==

- PRE-ATT&CK Matrixincludes techniques used for reconnaissance, target identification, and attack planning.
- Windows includes techniques used to hack all flavors of Windows.
- Linux includes techniques used to hack all flavors of Linux.
- MacOS includes techniques used to hack MacOS.
- Mobile ATT&CK matrix includes techniques used to attack mobile devices.

==The Enterprise ATT&CK matrix== is a superset of the Windows, MacOS, and Linux matrices. At the time of this writing, there are 245 techniques in the Enterprise model. MITRE regularly updates ATT&CK with the latest and greatest hacking techniques that hackers and security researchers discover in the wild.

## ==MITRE ATT&CK Uses==


![[mitre-attack-uses.png]]



- Use ATT&CK to plan your cyber security strategy. Build your defense to counter the known techniques and equip your monitoring to detect evidence of ATT&CK techniques in your network.
- ATT&CK is a reference for Incident Response (IR) teams. Your IR team can use ATT&CK to determine the nature of the threats you are encountering and methods to mitigate the threat.
- Your IR team can use ATT&CK as a _reference_ for new cybersecurity threats, and plan ahead.
- ATT&CK can help you assess your overall cybersecurity strategy and close any gaps that you discover.
